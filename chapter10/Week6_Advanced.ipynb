        "2. **Structure Your Demo**:\n",
        "   - **Introduction**: Briefly explain the purpose of the app (e.g., “This application demonstrates the use of colormaps for data visualization.”).\n",
        "   - **Feature Walkthrough**:\n",
        "     - Show the interface (dropdowns, sliders, etc.).\n",
        "     - Explain each feature (e.g., “Here’s a categorical colormap distinguishing five groups.”).\n",

        "#### **Host & Share Videos**\n",
        "- Upload the video to:\n",
        "  - **YouTube** (public or unlisted for easy sharing).\n",
        "  - **Vimeo** (for higher-quality streaming and customization).\n",
        "  - **Loom** (if recorded directly there).\n",
